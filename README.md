# AI-SHOPPING-SYSTEM
This code creates a ShoppingAI class that uses a neural network model to make product recommendations for customers based on their shopping history and preferences.

The ShoppingAI class has methods for adding items to a cart and calculating the total price of the items in the cart, just like the POS class in the previous example. However, it also has methods for training a machine learning model and making predictions with the trained model.

To use the code, you would first need to initialize the ShoppingAI class with the appropriate parameters, such as a list of products and their prices, and any applicable discounts. Then, you could train the AI model by providing sample data and labels. Once the model is trained, you could use the recommend method to make product recommendations for a customer based on their shopping history and preferences.

In this example, the AI model is trained on a small sample dataset consisting of three customer profiles, and then it makes recommendations for a fourth customer based on their profile. The AI may recommend products that are on sale or discounted, in order to provide the best value for the customer.
